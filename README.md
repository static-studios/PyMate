# PyMate
PyMate is one of my very minimal projects. I wont spend time working on it all the time.
\nPyMate is a buddy that you can talk to anytime anywhere. He usually sidetracks you from topics to make sure you don't get bored. Coded in pure Python (Python 3 or greater is required for him to run).
